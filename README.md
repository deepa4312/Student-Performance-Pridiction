# Student-Performance-Pridiction
This analysis has taught us that, factors such as parental level of education, socioeconomic disadvantage, test preparation courses affect the students’ performances in the exams. But there are many exceptions as well. There are students with a low parental level of education scoring full marks. Also, some students have not completed the test preparation course getting full marks. These students may have their own strategies for test preparations. Socioeconomic disadvantage also has many exceptions. These students did not allow economic obstacles to affect their efforts. So, many factors are affecting the students’ performances. Some have great effects while some not. Also, there are other factors to be considered as well which are not mentioned in the dataset. Factors such as facilities at school, the quality and methods of teaching, peer pressures, hours spent studying, diets, sleeping patterns etc. Such factors also affect the performance of the students.
